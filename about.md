  Hey there, I'm Micha≈Ç. <br>
  Test automation specialist, trainer, and evangelist. Technical testing, CI/CD, and Test/DevOps enthusiast. 
  A QA Lead responsible for quality-related aspects throughout the project lifecycle.
</p>

I like to automate not only tests but any repeatable task my team and I encounter, knowing that engineers can spend their time on more interesting things. In the projects I work on, I care about quality from their very beginning in the business development phase, throughout their definition and build, up until their launch. I was responsible for defining QA processes in these projects, coaching the team to follow them and constantly improve them.

I love to experiment with different approaches, fresh ideas, new tools so whenever that is possible - I try to incorporate them in my daily job. Continuous improvement is always my side goal.

I was speaking at: [PtaQ meetup](http://ptaq.org/), [PaprzyQarz meetup](http://papryqarz.org/)

If you would like to talk or need some consultation/training, feel free to [contact me](/contact/).

Currently, I work at [Cognifide](http://www.cognifide.com/) as a Senior QA Engineer, leading projects in the QA area and our internal test automation Center of Excellence. I am also one of the co-creators and maintainers of the [Bobcat framework](https://github.com/Cognifide/bobcat)

In my free time when I do not code or write anything else, I love to play video games, chill with some series or movies or just mess around with my 2 cats, though in case of the last one it's usually the other way around.
