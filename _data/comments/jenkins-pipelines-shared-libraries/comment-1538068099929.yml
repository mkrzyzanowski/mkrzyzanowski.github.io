  Have you found a good way to dynamically load a branch of said global
  libraries without having to use '@branch-name' at the end? I have multiple
  people who might fork/branch the global libs and it sort of seems like a
  pain... short of everyone adding their own global lib configuration or
  constantly updating their @Library calls (... and then remembering to put it
  back before submitting their PR's...) I'm not really sure how you handle this
  gracefully. Loading libs at runtime is a non-starter, need the classpath and
  everything in src/.
