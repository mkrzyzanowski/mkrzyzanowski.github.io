message: "So far I've been living with the same pain :/. It's a hidden advertisement of trunk-based development :D.\r\n\r\nBut right now with JCasC here, it might be worth to keep the branch info in the library configuration, swap it in the config file (see my post about JCasC: https://automatingguy.com/2018/09/25/jenkins-configuration-as-code/), test it locally on a Jenkins instance configured in a universal way, then merge the working stuff to master! This way, you can simply reference the library with `@Library('your-lib')` :)."
