message: "Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for this clear and didactic post.\r\nNevertheless I have a question about libraries.\r\nIf I correctly understand, it seems that the library must be at the root of a git repo.\r\nWorking in a complex / constrained environment, I need to store my library in a (les's say) `continuousIntegration` directory which is not at the root level.\r\nI don't understand in the configuration page how I can achieve that, as far as it seems that it does not offer the possibility to enter a directory path.\r\n\r\nIf I am wrong, any explanation would be appreciated. If I am right any suggestion would be welcomed.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help\r\nBest Regards\r\nJ-L"
