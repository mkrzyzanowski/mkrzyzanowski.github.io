  I disagree regarding the declarative.  I sort of feel like Jenkins wants to
  move over to declarative.  That is to say that declarative is new and is
  missing some features. We wrote our entire pipeline in declarative without
  using one scrip tag and it wasn't easy. Since we feel that starting with a
  script is sort of going against the flow, we went this route.
