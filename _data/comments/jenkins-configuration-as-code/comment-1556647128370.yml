  Hey just wanted to add a little note for configuring tools, something I
  stumbled across trying to set up MSBuild. The labels from the GUI themselves
  are not always super useful in determining what you should put in your .yaml
  file, but you can usually get a pretty good idea by examining the form fields
  themselves using Chrome developer tools or whatever for your preferred
  browser. This doesn't always work, but often the option name for casc will be
  the same as the name of the form field.
